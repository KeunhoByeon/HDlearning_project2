Hi everyone,

This email is about the second project, which gives you the opportunity to try another encoding method for HD encoding.

We already learned how OnlineHD and its non-linear encoding work, now you will use another older encoding method, Level-ID encoding, and try to find out the difference between them. In fact, the professor briefly introduced this method during the first few meetings. If you cannot recall, please read through the paper I attached to this email very carefully.

Task 1. Understand this paper and try to implement the encoding method using python (no need to make it support GPU, so you don't have to use PyTorch this time). 

Task 2. Perform HD learning on this 'isolet' voice dataset. I have attached the method to load the dataset. As for the learning method, you can use a similar method like in OnlineHD or you can also use a simpler learning method described in the paper. 

Someone might found this dataset familiar because I also included this dataset in Project 1. If you used this dataset before, it should be easier for you.

Task 3. Try to run OnlineHD on this dataset. Compare the performance difference between this non-linear encoding and the linear encoding you implement in Task 1.

If you still have time, you can even try to play with the parameters for level-id encoding, such as the number of levels and hypervector dimension.

PS: For students who do not get good results in Project 1, please go check the Google Drive we shared for the correct implementation. It will help you succeed in this project.

Have a great weekend and see you guys next week!

Best,
Yang Ni
